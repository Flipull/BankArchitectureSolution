# BankArchitectureSolution
Studying n-Tiered Architecture with a sample project

--------------------------------------------

Development of ArchitectureSolution v3. Needs work to approach 
the optimal structure of the architecture, as v3 was not properly 
designed. Current and Target v4 state are described (poorly) in UML.
(ArchitectureSolution4.mdj, made in StarUML)

Includes a document about the Hows and the Whys, including my
observed pros and cons when you deviate from laid paths.
